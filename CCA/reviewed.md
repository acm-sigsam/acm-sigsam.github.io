### Formally Reviewed Articles

The Communications in Computer Algebra
encourages writers to submit articles for timely
formally reviewed publication on the topic of
Symbolic Mathematical Computation, including

* Algorithms and Mathematics
* Theoretical and Experimental Computer Science in Symbolic Computation
* Applications of computer algebra in other fields

Papers intended for formal review should be submitted to the Editor in
Chief or Editor for Formally Reviewed Articles, preferably by electronic
mail, in the form of a source file written in LaTeX2e and using the [SIGSAM
LaTeX style file](https://www.sigsam.org/cca/sigsam.sty). Papers should be written in English, and authors are urged to
make a strong attempt to remove spelling and grammatical errors that might
confuse the reviewers.
