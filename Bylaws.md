Any fees for activities and services must be lower for members of the ACM.
All members of SIGSAM may vote in any ballot conducted with SIGSAM. On any ballot, the votes cast by non-ACM members of SIGSAM will, if necessary, be prorated downward so that their effective total cannot exceed 50% of the eligible vote.

The Chairman may fill vacancies in offices he has appointed according to the procedures for making the original appointments as provided herein.
Should a vacancy be unfilled, either because of inadequacy of these bylaws or because of a dispute or for any other reason, the SIG Board may fill it (as provided in Bylaw 6 of the ACM).

<h2>
Article 10. Amendments.
</h2>
These bylaws may be amended by a majority vote of the ACM Executive Committee, or by a vote of SIGSAM's members as provided below.

All proposed amendments must be approved prior to being submitted for a vote of the membership, by the Chairman of both the SIG Board and the Constitution and Bylaws of ACM after the Executive Director of ACM has provided his advice.
The ballot on the proposed amendment(s) will be conducted among the eligible voters by ACM Headquarters following the procedures of the ACM for voting bylaw amendments, unless a different procedure has been approved by the SIG Board. The proposal is adopted only if at least 2/3 of the effective votes of returned ballots approve it, and only if at least 1/4 of the ballots are returned. The Secretary-Treasurer will send a clean copy of the amended bylaws to the Executive Director of ACM and to the Chairman of the SIG Board.

<h2>
Article 11. Finance.
</h2>
The responsibility for collecting, holding and disbursing funds is delegated to SIGSAM under the terms of a Financial Accountability Policy agreed upon by the Board and the Executive Committee of the ACM. Should there be disagreement on the interpretation of such a policy, the interpretation of the Executive Committee of the ACM will prevail unless changed by the ACM Council.
Funds of SIGSAM are the property of the ACM.
SIGSAM will be financially self-supporting in accordance with the Financial Accountability Policy. SIGSAM collective retained-earnings, beyond the required retained-earnings reserves, may be used for non-SIGSAM ACM activities only with approval of both the Board and the Executive Committee of the ACM, or of 2/3 of all members of the ACM Council.
