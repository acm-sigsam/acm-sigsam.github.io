The 2013 Richard D. Jenks Memorial Prize for Excellence in Software Engineering Applied to Computer Algebra was announced by members of the Prize Selection Committee, Mark Giesbrecht representing its chair Erich Kaltofen, at ISSAC in Boston, MA, on June 28, 2013 to have been awarded to Professor William Arthur Stein of the Sage Project at the University of Washington . The Prize includes a Plaque and has a monetary award of $1,000.

William Stein is the creator of the Sage platform www.sagemath.org, which, based on the Python programming language, makes available for integrated use a number of computer algebra programs such as Magma, Maple, Mathematica, MuPAD, and which includes Axiom, GAP, GP/PARI, LinBox, Macaulay2, Maxima, Octave, and Singular, among others. Sage also provides its own programming language Cython.

William Stein has been able to attract hundreds of followers to Sage, who have contributed to the open source base of Sage and who have already met for dozens of Sage Days on several continents. Some of the algorithms in Sage constitute the fastest implementations for the given problems.

Sage's free software philosophy has attracted thousands of users all over the world to undertake computations for mathematical research and development.
